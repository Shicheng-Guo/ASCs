### RNA-seq 

I am quite surprise when I notice most significant differential gene is IFI44L since I have published two manuscript*1*,*2* about this gene in the past two years. IFI44L was hypo-methylated in autoimmune diseases and therefore it is upregulated in autoimmune disease patient. We could find IFI44L, IFI44, IFITM1, IFI6, IRF7, IFITM3, IFIT3, IFI27 are significantly up-regulated in SLE patients. It is consistent with our RNA-seq data in SLE patients. Meanwhile, we identified several interesting lncRNAs such as BISPR, LINC02384 indicating lncRNA might play certain roles in SLE pathology.
